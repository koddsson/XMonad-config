My XMonad & XMobar config
-------------------------

+ Forked from Sk√∫li and altered to suit my needs
+ Running Arch Linux
+ In addition to ZSH and lots of goodies
+ No Gnome, no Unity, pure pleasure and eye candy!

TODO
====

+ Create a custom Exec script instead of running directly XMonad
  + Add custom startup programs there (mainly xscreensaver)
+ Add weather and network info to XMobar
+ -Add icons instead of labels in xmobar-
  + Apparently xmobar does not support icons, but there are other solutions such as [dzen](https://github.com/robm/dzen)
